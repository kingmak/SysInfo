# SysInfo
A windows only utility to retrieve information about your machine<br>

This utility utilizes the SystemMaloomat library to produce its results. Maloomat is a word taken from the Urdu language which means Infomration, thus SystemInformation. For now the code for SystemMaloomat is being kept proprietary.<br>

Currently the utility supports getting Processor Information & BIOS Information. There are plans to add HDD & RAM information as well.
